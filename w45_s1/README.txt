NOTES:
% The brain states presented in the supplementary analysis were reordered according to their occurrence frequency in descending order.
% The mapping between original state labels (from 'cluster_stats.mat') and the new state labels (used in the paper)
% for window length = 45s is as follows:
% Original State 3 (32.44%) → State 1 (most frequent)
% Original State 2 (31.75%) → State 2
% Original State 1 (24.45%) → State 3
% Original State 4 (11.36%) → State 4 (least frequent)
